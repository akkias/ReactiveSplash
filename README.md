# Coding Challenge

Hi,

this coding task is the easiest and most difficult task at the same time,
because it has almost no constraints at all (well ... almost).

The actual task is easily explained, just create **whatever you want**. And here
are the few constraints:

- In this repo, we have prepared an empty
  [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) bootstrap ...
  so use **react.js**.
- The only other constraint is the time. You should send the challenge back
  within **three days**. And you shold not spend more than 3 or 4 hours on it
  (we can't control it but we don't neccessarily honour more complex tasks over
  well made small solutions).

This means

- find a small project that is suitable for this. Whether it's a cool cutting
  edge layout / animation task or an invisible performance tool is fully up to
  you
- think of the focus you want to set. The project doesnt't have to be perfect,
  but it should work.
- be explicit and understandable with your code. Tip: You can also use commit
  messages for documenting progress.
- decide by yourself between edge technologies (like css grid) or compatibility
  (like IE 11, mobile or a11y). Both can have value.
- feel free to add any other dependency you need from **npm**
- in case you want to consume a public API, please make sure that it also runs
  for us reviewers (remember `yarn start` should work)

Finally have fun and good luck!

We are looking forward to your solution ...
